# Miashs project : Moteur de recherche de bibioth√®que
 
This project is an attempt to index Gutenberg library in an Elasticsearch DB.

Inspired by https://github.com/guoqiao/gutenberg which is an RDF Parser to retrieve metadata of ebooks.

## Indexing :
The python library [gutenberg.py](link) parse the RDF files, retrieves the metadata including the url of the ebook, then it scrapes the content of url and indexes the result in Elasticsearch.

* ## Searching :
The [gutt.py](link)  queries the RESTful API and takes the term searched as a parameter then processes a json result.

* ## Displaying :
[display_response.php](link) is responsible for displaying the json response in a nice layout accessible remotely by a browser.
